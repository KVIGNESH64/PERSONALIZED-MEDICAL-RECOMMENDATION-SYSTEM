# 🫀 Personalized Medical Recommendation System using Heart Disease Detection  
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the risk of heart disease and provide personalized health recommendations based on patient data.
By combining **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with classification models, the system analyzes health indicators to support early detection and preventive care. 
### 🔍 Key Features
- Predicts heart disease risk (Low Risk / High Risk)
- Performs in-depth EDA to identify important health patterns
- Trains and compares multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
